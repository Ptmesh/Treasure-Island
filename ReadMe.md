# Project 3: Treasure Island

Welcome to Project 3 of my 100 Days of Code journey with Python!

## Description

In this project, I've created a text-based adventure game called Treasure Island. The game takes players on an exciting journey where they navigate through various scenarios and make choices that determine their fate. Will they discover the hidden treasure, or will they face perilous obstacles along the way? The outcome depends on the decisions they make!

## Flowchart

A flowchart that illustrates the gameplay mechanics of Treasure Island is added in the repo

## Features

- Engaging text-based gameplay
- Multiple possible endings based on user choices
- Exciting storyline with unexpected twists and turns

## Usage

To play Treasure Island, simply run the `main.py` file in your Python environment. Follow the prompts on the screen to make choices and progress through the game. Be prepared for surprises and think carefully before making decisions!

## Getting Started

To get started with Treasure Island, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the `main.py` file using Python.
4. Enjoy the adventure and try to uncover the hidden treasures!
